Few days ago, one men from rent-a-coder site offer me
some kind of job, to write some graphics routines. I never
heard him again, but among required tasks was starting
Common Dialog with thumbnails. This problem intriguing me,
because I have no clue how to do it. So I start to search 
on Internet for solution, find only one which was not working
on my Win2000 (on WinXP it does). And it used timer. 
I have lost two days, but finally got solution that works both
on 2k and XP, inside of windows messages, so it can be debug.
This is not what we call "coding by the book" but it works fine.
It is much easer to instruct user to push that button(MenuBar) and
set View Menu, but I also saw people who were programming thumbnails view.
So, it can be usefull in some situations to set thumbnails by code
in Common Dialog.
I know that you can make it better, so than do it.
And don't forget to share your code with rest of us VB programmers.
